# Gartner-Curation
This is repository for Gartner Curation. Don't take it personally but I know there are a lot of software developers who immerse themself in their code day and night with no basic knowledge of their industry. They doesn't even know news about their product which the program code they developed will be reflected. I'm not sure that is a good idea....

So, I decided that I need to make effort not only programming skills but also the acknowledgement of the market trends and flow by heart as if I'm following up with my baby. It has got to enhance my capability of making good decisions and providing good advice to other companies regarding overtaking its competitors.
